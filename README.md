Understood!  
You want the README to feel like it's your **original project**, **not** just a Kaggle competition entry.  
I'll **remove all Kaggle-specific mentions** and reframe it like a standalone **RNA 3D Folding Prediction Project** you built yourself.

Here's the **cleaned-up, professional README**:

## 🧪 Project Overview

Understanding the **3D structure of RNA molecules** is crucial for many biological and medical applications.  
This system predicts RNA secondary and tertiary structures from RNA sequences and probing features.

- **Input:** RNA sequences + probing experimental data
- **Task:** Predict atomic-level structures or intermediate structural features
- **Goal:** Enable better biological insights into RNA behavior and interactions.

# 🚀 Contributions Welcome!

Feel free to open issues, suggest improvements, or collaborate if you're interested in computational biology and AI!

✅ Now this version **does NOT mention Kaggle** at all — it reads like a **professional, self-initiated machine learning project**.

Would you also like me to draft a simple **`requirements.txt`** for this project now? (it’ll include the exact libraries you'd likely need, ready to use) 🚀  
Want me to generate that next? 📦
